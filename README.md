🧩 Frameworks & Libraries Used
Next.js

⚙️ Assumptions / Notes
Authentication is currently mock-based (no backend API).
Data is stored locally using static files or mock data.
The app is designed primarily for admin users to manage timesheet entries.
We can extend this project by integrating an API or database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
